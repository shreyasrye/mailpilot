Also, to keep things semi-high level, limit the number of labels to the maximum mentioned, and if desired labels were provided, create more that go up to the maximum limit if they aren't as many). Provide the output as a json with just the braces and 'key':'value' pairs with quotations around both. Don't include anything other than the json in the output- no titles, descriptions, headers or anything. \n"
